## About The Project

![Screenshot](docs/images/demo.gif)

A challenge almost every project eventually faces is importing user uploaded data from CSV files in a way that doesn't cause a ton of issues. Developers always have to figure out

- How do you make sure that data uploaded is correct
- How do you notify the user that the data is incorrect before they upload it, and give the user a chance to fix it
- Incorrect or duplicate data that is uploaded is super annoying to try to fix after-the-fact
- Run automatic formatters (ex: phone number formatting), but providing a way for the user to see what our formatter did before uploading as a sanity check

HelloCSV a Javascript library that drops in a CSV importer into your project that:

- Supports custom columns
- with custom validations
- and custom transformations
- a nice UI that walks a user through a 4 step process of uploading a CSV (upload, map columns, preview data, upload confirmation)
- with a small JS footprint
- that doesn't assume your frontend stack
