Deployment is done with the following steps

1. Change version in `package.json` (to the target version) - use branch `release/v{x.y.z}`

2. Run `npm i` in the root directory as well as in `example` and `example-vanilla` directories

3. Update version in docs

For minor version release

- update version in `docs/docs.json` file
- update directory name of `docs/v{oldVersion}` to `docs/v{newVersion}`
- make sure to update all references to the old version in the `docs/docs.json` file

For major version release

- create a new directory in `docs` called `v{newVersion}`
- copy all files from `docs/v{oldVersion}` to `docs/v{newVersion}`
- create a new version entry in `docs/docs.json` file
- write upgrade guide and put it in the docs

4. Update version in `InstallTabs.tsx::no build`, `example/index.html`, `README.md` and `example-preact/src/App.tsx`

5. Verify if `importer/storage.ts:DB_VERSION` needs to be bumped. It should be bumped anytime the release contains any breaking changes to `ImporterState`. If it is true, increment the `DB_VERSION`.

6. Create a PR in the repository called `Release v{x.y.z}`

7. Run `npm publish` in the root directory, you can use `--dry-run` flag to test the deployment

8. Create a new release in Github - https://github.com/HelloCSV/HelloCSV/releases. Remember about creating a tag (`v{x.y.z}`) and writing release notes.

9. Merge `main` to `production` branch - this would trigger docs deployment to Mintlify.
